### Run function for 4 highway speeds
```{r}
# mass of truck, m = 31752 kg
# surface area of car, surface_area = 9 m^2

# run function for each of the highway speeds (30, 80 km/hr, 120 km/hr, 40 km/hr) -- need to convert units for the last 3 speeds
power_watts(mass_kg = 31752, velocity = c(30, 80, 120, 40), surface_area = 9)
```
